After many iterations, new designs, redesigns of redesigns and stack changes the blog is, finally, live!

No matter how good the design was, there was always that once piece missing. It took some time to accept the fact that some things cant be perfect and that it's okay.

### So why the journey ?

This blog has two purposes:
To help me visualize my maturity as a developer and a person.
To help those that feel lost and confused building the web.
My plan is to share both my experiences and knowledge with you but also to get some from you too. This blog is all going to be all about giving and receiving.

### What kind of topics will you write about ?

While I plan to keep the website related to web development, you can also expect topics about :
User interface and user experience;
Psychology;
Science;
Rants;

So let's get started.
